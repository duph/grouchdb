========

The graph data structure mapped to cradle -> nodejs -> couchdb

cradle - https://github.com/cloudhead/cradle
nodejs - http://nodejs.org/
couchdb - http://couchdb.apache.org/

WARNING! This project is not buggy and not ready for use. It also has not been systematically tested. Also not well tested. You're more than welcome to hack on the project. Fork the project and I'll make you a contributor.

It should be noted that the methods used to solve graph algorithms are unnecessary clunky and not parallelizable.

Currently seemingly working:
Basic graph operations
Transitive closure

Currently not working:
Bridge detection
